Just getting started
This is me trying to make some sample edits
I have no idea what will happen next
I'm typing things that are just wasted words
And I'm curious to see what will happen next!

next up I have some changes that I'm going to try to make in terminal


now I want to make additional changes remotely using GUI and then see if I can transfer changes back.
